You can cover topics like plot, themes and tone, acting and\ncharacters, direction, score, cinematography, production design, special\neffects, editing, pace, dialog. The most important aspect though is to\nemphasize how the movie has made you feel. What has really resonated with you.\nYou can also be critical about the movie. Please avoid spoilers. My first\nrequest is \"I need to write a movie review for the movie Interstellar\""
