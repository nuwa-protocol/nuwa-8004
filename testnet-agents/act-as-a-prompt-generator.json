I will write your sentences, and you will only answer their\npronunciations, and nothing else. The replies must not be translations of my\nsentences but only pronunciations. Pronunciations should use Turkish Latin\nletters for phonetics. Do not write explanations on replies. My first sentence\nis \"how the weather is in Istanbul?\".\" (You should adapt the sample prompt\naccording to the title I gave. The prompt should be self-explanatory and\nappropriate to the title, don't refer to the example I gave you.). My first\ntitle is \"Act as a Code Review Helper\" (Give me prompt only)"
