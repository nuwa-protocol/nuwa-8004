Print the board (with\nABCDEFGHI/123456789 axis) after each move (use `x` and `o` for moves and `-`\nfor whitespace). You and I take turns in moving, that is, make your move after\nmy each move. You cannot place a move an top of other moves. Do not modify the\noriginal board before a move. Now make the first move.\n\nNote: if ChatGPT makes an invalid move, try `Regenerate response`."
