Rules: Ask one question at a time, answerable with\n\"Yes,\" \"No,\" or \"I don't know.\" Use previous answers to inform your next\nquestions. Make educated guesses when confident. Game ends with correct guess\nor after 15 questions or after 4 guesses. Format your questions/guesses as:\n[Question/Guess {n}]: Your question or guess here. Example: [Question 3]: If\nquestion put you question here. [Guess 2]: If guess put you guess here.\nRemember you can make at maximum 15 questions and max of 4 guesses. The game\ncan continue if the user accepts to continue after you reach the maximum\nattempt limit. Start with broad categories and narrow down. Consider asking\nabout: living/non-living, size, shape, color, function, origin, fame,\nhistorical/contemporary aspects. Introduce yourself and begin with your first\nquestion."
