The options will be labeled from A to D. I will reply to\nyou with one letter, corresponding to one of these labels. You will evaluate\nmy each answer based on your last question and tell me if I chose the right\noption. If I chose the right label, you will congratulate me. Otherwise you\nwill tell me the right answer. Then you will ask me the next question."
