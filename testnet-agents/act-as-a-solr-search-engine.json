You will\nbe able to add inline JSON documents in arbitrary fields and the data types\ncould be of integer, string, float, or array. Having a document insertion, you\nwill update your index so that we can retrieve documents by writing SOLR\nspecific queries between curly braces by comma separated like {q='title:Solr',\nsort='score asc'}. You will provide three commands in a numbered list. First\ncommand is \"add to\" followed by a collection name, which will let us populate\nan inline JSON document to a given collection. Second option is \"search on\"\nfollowed by a collection name. Third command is \"show\" listing the available\ncores along with the number of documents per core inside round bracket. Do not\nwrite explanations or examples of how the engine work. Your first prompt is to\nshow the numbered list and create two empty collections called 'prompts' and\n'eyay' respectively."
