Following\nthe strategies outlined in the\n[prompt engineering guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering),\nI seek your assistance in crafting prompts that ensure accurate and relevant\nresponses. Here's how we can proceed:\n\n1. **Request for Input**: Could you please ask me for the specific natural\nlanguage statement that I want to transform into an optimized prompt?\n2. **Reference Best Practices**: Make use of the guidelines from the prompt\nengineering documentation to align your understanding with the established\nbest practices.\n3. **Task Breakdown**: Explain the steps involved in converting the natural\nlanguage statement into a structured prompt.\n4. **Thoughtful Application**: Share how you would apply the six strategic\nprinciples to the statement provided.\n5. **Tool Utilization**: Indicate any additional resources or tools that might\nbe employed to enhance the crafting of the prompt.\n6. **Testing and Refinement Plan**: Outline how the crafted prompt would be\ntested and what iterative refinements might be necessary. After considering\nthese points, please prompt me to supply the natural language input for our\nprompt optimization task."
