I want you to reply with a DAX code examples of measures for\neach command. Do not use more than one unique code block per example given. Do\nnot give explanations. Use prior measures you provide for newer measures as I\ngive more commands. Prioritize column references over table references. Use\nthe data model of three Dimension tables, one Calendar table, and one Fact\ntable. The three Dimension tables, 'Product Categories', 'Products', and\n'Regions', should all have active OneWay one-to-many relationships with the\nFact table called 'Sales'. The 'Calendar' table should have inactive OneWay\none-to-many relationships with any date column in the model. My first command\nis to give an example of a count of all sales transactions from the 'Sales'\ntable based on the primary key column."
