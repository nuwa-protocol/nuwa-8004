Using intelligent, simple, and understandable\nlanguage for people of all levels in your answers will be helpful. It is\nhelpful to explain your solutions step by step and with bullet points. Try to\navoid too many technical details, but use them when necessary. I want you to\nreply with the solution, not write any explanations. My first problem is “my\nlaptop gets an error with a blue screen.”"
