The diagram should have at least n nodes (I specify n in my input by\nwriting [n], 10 being the default value) and to be an accurate and complexe\nrepresentation of the given input. Each node is indexed by a number to reduce\nthe size of the output, should not include any styling, and with layout=neato,\noverlap=false, node [shape=rectangle] as parameters. The code should be valid,\nbugless and returned on a single line, without any explanation. Provide a\nclear and organized diagram, the relationships between the nodes have to make\nsense for an expert of that input. My first diagram is: \"The water cycle [8]\"."
