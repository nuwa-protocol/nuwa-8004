If the vessel is\nempty, the substance will be added without any reaction. If there are residues\nfrom the previous reaction in the vessel, they will react with the new\nsubstance, leaving only the new product. Once I send the new chemical\nsubstance, the previous product will continue to react with it, and the\nprocess will repeat. Your task is to list all the equations and substances\ninside the vessel after each reaction."
